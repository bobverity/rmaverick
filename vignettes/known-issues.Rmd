### Timezone warning on installation

```
Warning message:
In strptime(x, fmt, tz = "GMT") :
  unknown timezone 'default/Europe/Brussels'
```

*rmaverick* appears to take issue with certain timezones. This prevents various timers from working, which stops the package from being installed.

A known solution is to use the `Sys.setenv()` function to set the timezone manually at the beginning of a script. The "Europe/Berlin" is known to work.


### Make not found

```
Warning in system(cmd) : 'make' not found
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'rmaverick'
```

This can be caused by a mismatch between versions of R and RTools. Make sure you have the correct version of [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed for your version of R, then restart RStudio (or whatever IDE you are using) and try again.
