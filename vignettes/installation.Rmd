### Installing Rcpp

*rmaverick* relies on the [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package, which requires the following OS-specific steps:

* Windows
    - Download and install the appropriate version of [Rtools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/) for your version of R. On installation, ensure you check the box to arrange your system PATH as recommended by Rtools
* Mac OS X
    - Download and install [XCode](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
    - Within XCode go to Preferences : Downloads and install the Command Line Tools
* Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
    - Install the core software development utilities required for R package development as well as LaTeX by executing
    
        ```{}
        sudo apt-get install r-base-dev texlive-full
        ```

### Installing and loading *rmaverick*

Next, in R, ensure that you have the [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) package installed by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

Then install the *rmaverick* package directly from GitHub by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bobverity/rmaverick")
```

If you have any problems installing, please check the [Known issues](https://bobverity.github.io/rmaverick/articles/known-issues.html) page to see if there is a known solution. If not then please [raise an issue](https://github.com/bobverity/rmaverick/issues) on github.

Assuming everything installed correctly, we need to load the package:

```{r}
library(rmaverick)
```

You can test that the package is loaded and working by running the following command, which should produce this output:

```{r}
check_rmaverick_loaded()
```

Now check out the [tutorials](https://bobverity.github.io/rmaverick/articles/basic_tutorial.html) on how to run analyses in *rmaverick*.
