The goal of *rmaverick* is to infer population structure from genetic data. What makes *rmaverick* different from other similar programs is its ability to estimate the *evidence* for different numbers of sub-populations (K), and even different evolutionary models, through a method called generalised thermodynamic integration (GTI). *rmaverick* is an updated version of the earlier program [MavericK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4981280/), and comes with a number of new features that make it more powerful and easier to use.

**It is worth stating at the outset that rmaverick is designed for relatively small data sets of the order of hundreds of samples and tens to hundreds of loci. It is not designed for large-scale genomic data sets (e.g. thousands of SNPs), for which other programs are more appropriate.**

Details of the package, including vignettes on installing and running the package, can be found on the [main webpage](https://bobverity.github.io/rmaverick/).
