\title{Create new parameter set}
\usage{
new_set(
  project,
  name = "(no name)",
  lambda = 1,
  admix_on = FALSE,
  alpha = 0.1,
  estimate_alpha = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{an rmaverick project, as produced by the function 
\code{mavproject()}}

\item{name}{the name of the parameter set}

\item{lambda}{shape parameter of the dirichlet prior on allele frequencies in
each subpopulation}

\item{admix_on}{whether to allow admixture between subpopulations, in which
case each gene copy can be assigned to a different subpopulation}

\item{alpha}{parameter governing the strength of admixture. Higher values
give greater probability of a gene copy being assigned to different
subpopulations, while as alpha tends to zero we converge back at the
no-admixture model in which all gene copies within an individual are
constrained to have originated from the same subpopulation}

\item{estimate_alpha}{whether the value of alpha should be estimated as part
of the MCMC, in which case the value \code{alpha} is ignored}
}
\description{
Create a new parameter set within an rmaverick project. The new 
  parameter set becomes the active set once created.
